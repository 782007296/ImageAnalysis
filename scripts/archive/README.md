This is where old scripts go to work on all the projects they wanted
to do all their lives, but never had time due to kids and career.

## 4d-reset-matches-ned1.py

   start with all the original pair-wise matches, assemble them into a
   unified match structure and estimate their 3d location. (earlier
   revision.)

## 4d-reset-matches-ned2.py

   start with all the original pair-wise matches, assemble them into a
   unified match structure and estimate their 3d
   location. (intermediate revision.)

## 4z-collapse-matches.py

   similar to the reset-matches scripts, but also attempts to do full
   feature chain match grouping.  The jury is still out on whether
   this code is correct, or if it over constrains the problem and
   causes trouble for the optimizer.
